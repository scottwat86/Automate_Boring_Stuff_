# Vid Lesson 1 is just an intro and setup

# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 3
# Vid Lesson 2 - Expressions / Data Types / Variables

# Expressions basic programing instruction
2 + 2  # Expression = Values & Operators
# Always reduce to single Values

# Operators -> Follow standard order of operations
5 - 3 # subtraction
3 * 7 # Multiplicaiton
22 / 7 # Division -> returns float
2 + 3 * 6 #  2 + 18 = 20
(2 + 3) * 6 # 5 * 6 =30
(5 - 1) * ((7 + 1) / (3- 1))  # 4 * (8 / 2) = 4 * 4 = 16

# Errors are returned if the code can't be understood by interpreter
5 + # error indicates that something went wrong with the code


# Data type  -> All values have exactly one data type
# Integer
-2
30
# float
42.0
# String
"String"
'String'
"""String"""
"Alice" + "Bob" # String Concantenation
"Alice" * 4 # String Replication

# Variable is similar to a box that can store values
spam = 42 # box labeled "spam" with a value of 42 inside
spam = "hello"
spam+" world" # overwriting the inital value
# need to the space as python iterprets literally

# Statement do not evaluate to a single value
spam = 10
spam += 1
